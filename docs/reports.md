# Reports

The "Reports" page in the RAFVue application provides a comprehensive set of reports to analyze and monitor various aspects of the Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) process. These reports offer valuable insights into patient populations, HCC data, productivity metrics, reviewer performance, provider performance, review activities, follow-up activities, and population analysis.

## Available Reports

1. **Risk Adjustment Summary**: Provides an overview of the risk adjustment data for the selected patient population, including RAF scores, HCC recapture rates, patient demographics, and top chronic HCCs.

2. **HCC Summary**: Focuses on the HCC data for the selected patient population, including total HCCs, ICD-10-CM codes, visits, cost of care, HCC acuity, and chronic HCC recapture rates.

3. **Productivity**: Offers insights into the productivity metrics of the review process, such as patient count, reviews completed, reviewers, queries, and RAF scores.

4. **Reviewer Analysis**: Presents a focused report on individual reviewers or groups, including review completion rates, audit percentages, performance rates, and query-related metrics.

5. **Provider Performance**: Analyzes the performance of providers, including total providers, specialty types, patient counts, HCC recapture rates, RAF scores, and query-related metrics.

6. **Review Activity Reports**: Generates detailed reports on review activities, including a summary report and a detail report with optional rationale. These reports provide information on patients, reviews, HCCs, ICD-10 codes, and reviewer actions.

7. **Follow-up Analysis**: Focuses on the follow-up activities, including total patients, follow-up rates, queries, query statuses, update claim statuses, and process rates.

8. **Population Analysis**: Provides an analysis of the patient population based on various factors such as site, payor, review status, review type, and Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) status.

## Customization and Filtering

The reports in the RAFVue application are highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the data based on their specific needs. The following customization and filtering options are available:

- **Time Range**: Most reports have a default patient range set to the current year-to-date (YTD). However, users can drill down and filter the data by time filters based on dates of service (DOS) to focus on specific periods.

- **Patient Population**: Users can select specific patient populations for analysis, such as patients associated with certain providers, specialties, or payors.

- **Report-Specific Filters**: Each report may have additional filters or options specific to its content, allowing users to refine the data based on relevant criteria.

## Data Visualization and Export

The reports in the RAFVue application provide clear and concise data visualization to facilitate understanding and analysis. The data is presented through various formats, including:

- **Tables**: Many reports display data in tabular format, allowing users to view detailed information in a structured manner.

- **Graphs and Charts**: Some reports include graphical representations such as bar charts, line charts, or pie charts to visualize trends, comparisons, and distributions.

- **Export Options**: Users can export the report data to common formats such as Excel or CSV for further analysis or sharing with other stakeholders.
