# Login

This documentation outlines the steps involved in the login process for our application.

## Step 1: Enter Credentials

On the login page, users are required to enter their username and password. The entered credentials are then validated against the stored user information.

## Step 2: First Login Password Reset

If the user is logging in for the first time after their account was created, they will be prompted to reset their password. You will get the reset mail for the registered email.

This helps ensure that the user is setting a password of their own choice and enhances security.


## Step 3: Setting up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

As an additional layer of security, users are required to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) after their first login and password reset.

During this step, a QR code will be displayed on the screen. Users need to scan this QR code using the Google Authenticator app on their mobile device.

Google Authenticator will generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) that users will need to enter along with their username and password for subsequent logins.

## Step 4: Login with MFA

For all subsequent logins, users will be required to provide their username, password, and the TOTP generated by Google Authenticator.

If the entered credentials and TOTP are valid, the user will be successfully authenticated and granted access to the application.
